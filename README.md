# Angular 2 Essential Training

This is the repository for my course, [Angular 2 Essential Training](https://www.lynda.com/AngularJS-tutorials/AngularJS-2-Essential-Training/422834-2.html). 
The full course is available at [lynda.com](https://lynda.com).  

## Course Description

JavaScript frameworks help you code more quickly, by providing special functionality for developing specific types of web projects. Angular was designed by Google to address challenges programmers face building single-page applications. This course introduces you to the essentials of this "superheroic" framework, including declarative templates, two-way data binding, and dependency injection. Justin Schwartzenberger steps through the framework one feature at a time, focusing on the new component-based architecture of Angular 2. After completing this training, you'll be able to tackle the other project-based courses in our library and create your own Angular app.

Topics include:
- What is Angular?
- Setting up an Angular template
- Creating a component
- Displaying data
- Working with events
- Using two-way data binding
- Creating a subcomponent
- Using the built-in HTTP module
- Using the built-in router module
